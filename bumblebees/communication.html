<p><strong>Bumblebees do not have ears</strong>, and it is not known whether or how well they can hear. However, they are sensitive to the vibrations made by sound travelling through wood or other materials.</p>

<p>Bumblebees do not exhibit the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance">bee dances</a>" used by honeybees to tell other workers the locations of food sources. Instead, when they return from a successful foraging expedition, they run excitedly around in the nest for several minutes before going out to forage once more. These bees may be offering some form of communication based on the buzzing sounds made by their wings, which may stimulate other bees to start foraging. Another stimulant to foraging activity is the level of food reserves in the colony. Bees monitor the amount of honey in the honeypots, and when little is left or when high quality food is added, they are more likely to go out to forage.</p>

<p>Bumblebees have been observed to partake in social learning. In a 2017 study involving <i class="taxonomy"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombus_terrestris">Bombus terrestris</a></i>, bees were taught to complete an unnatural task of moving large objects to obtain a reward. Bees that first observed another bee complete the task were significantly more successful in learning the task than bees that observed the same action performed by a magnet, indicating the importance of social information. The bees did not copy each other exactly: in fact, the study suggested that the bees were instead attempting to emulate each other's goals.</p>
